# Sandy ISA

I sat down with [Sandy](https://github.com/thecsw/) one day and we challenged each other to create an ISA and a VM.

It's very basic and I just tried to embrace myself with the Rust langdev ecosystem and so I used tools that are *wayyy* too overkill for an assembler.

We had a 24 hour time limit and so the code is not nearly as neat and structured as it can be, but I'm still quite happy with how it turned out.

Check his implementation out [here](https://github.com/thecsw/VMAGI)!
